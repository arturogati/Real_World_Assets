# 🌐 **TokenizeLocal**  
## **Tokenization of Small Businesses with Automated Dividend Payouts**
---
### 🔍 1. Problem  
Small and medium-sized businesses face several challenges:
| Problem | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| Lack of investment | Banks are reluctant to lend, and funds ignore small projects. |
| Liquidity of business share | Investors find it difficult to exit or sell their stake. |
| Trust in data | Financial reporting is often unavailable or opaque. |
| Profit distribution | No mechanism for automatic distribution of income among investors. |
---
### 💡 2. Solution  
**TokenizeLocal** is a platform for tokenizing business shares through a centralized database-based system. It enables:
- Businesses to issue tokens linked to a portion of their revenue.
- Investors to purchase tokens and receive **monthly dividends**.
- The platform to evolve from a simple database to a blockchain ecosystem.
---
### 📈 3. How It Works?
#### For a business:
1. **Registration by INN** → Company status is verified via the Checko API.
2. **Token issuance** → Number of tokens and revenue share percentage are defined.
3. **Revenue data update** → Revenue information is submitted to the system.
4. **Automatic dividend distribution** → Amount is distributed among all token holders.
#### For a user / investor:
1. **Registration / Authentication** → Email + password.
2. **Select a business** → View companies and available tokens.
3. **Purchase tokens** → User receives tokens.
4. **Monthly dividends** → Payouts proportional to the number of tokens held.
---
### 🧩 4. Project Structure  
Initially, the system is built on a centralized database (`SQLite`) with future scalability:
- **blockchain/db_manager.py** — Manages businesses, tokens, and user balances.
- **verification/api_client.py** — Verifies company status via Checko API.
- **utils/logger.py** — Event logging.
- **main.py** — Entry point, implements all business logic.
- **blockchain/users.py** — User registration and authentication.
- **blockchain/records_check.py** — Database content verification.
---
### 📁 5. Database Tables
| Table | Description |
|------|-----------|
| `businesses` | Stores company INN and name |
| `token_issuances` | Number of issued tokens |
| `users` | Email, name, password |
| `user_tokens` | User token balances |
| `dividend_history` | Dividend payment history |
---
### 🧠 6. Key Benefits
| For Business | For Investor |
|-------------|-------------|
| Alternative to bank loans | Low entry threshold — can buy 1 token |
| Global access to investors | Passive income from real revenue |
| Automatic dividend payments | Token value grows as business grows |
| Financial data transparency | Access to company info via API |
| Ability to buy back tokens | Exit via secondary market (in future) |
---
### 📊 7. Economic Model
#### Dividend Mechanism:
Each token grants a right to a share of monthly dividends calculated by the formula:
$$
\text{Dividend per token} = \frac{\text{Business Revenue} \times \text{Profit Share}}{\text{Total Number of Tokens}}
$$
##### Example:
- Revenue: $10,000
- Profit Share: 10%
- Tokens: 10,000
- Dividend per token: $0.10
- Investor with 1,000 tokens receives: $100/month → **ROI 10% per month**
> 💡 As business and revenue grow — dividends and token price increase.

### 🌐 15. Support for Global APIs to Verify Businesses
Currently, the platform is **fully integrated with Checko API** and supports **company verification by INN in the Russian Federation**. This allows fast and reliable verification of company status and access to revenue data.
**In the near-term scaling plan**, geographic expansion and support for international businesses are planned via:
| Region | Identifier | API |
|-------|------------|-----|
| Russia | INN | Checko |
| EU | VAT ID | VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) |
| USA | EIN | Dun & Bradstreet, OpenCorporates |
| Asia | BRN / CRN | Local Business Registries (e.g., Singapore ACRA, Japan Teikoku) |
#### Integration Plan:
1. **EU (VAT ID)** — 1–2 months: Verify company status and EU registration.
2. **USA (EIN)** — 2–3 months: Integration with Dun & Bradstreet and IRS.
3. **Asia** — 3–6 months: Support for Singapore, Japan, UAE.
4. **Global** — OpenCorporates for all other countries.
> ✅ This will allow investors to purchase tokens **not only from Russian but also international businesses**, making the platform global.
