## 🌐 **TokenizeLocal**  
## **Tokenizing Small Businesses with Automatic Dividend Payouts**  

---  

### 🔍 1. The Problem  
Small and medium-sized businesses face several challenges:  

| Problem | Description |  
|---------|--------|  
| Lack of Investment | Banks are reluctant to lend, and funds often ignore small projects. |  
| Liquidity of Business Shares | Investors struggle to exit deals or sell their stakes. |  
| Trust in Data | Financial reporting is often inaccessible or opaque. |  
| Profit Distribution | No mechanism for automatically distributing income among investors. |  

---  

### 💡 2. The Solution  

**TokenizeLocal** is a platform for tokenizing business shares via a centralized database system. It enables:  
- Businesses to issue tokens tied to a share of their revenue.  
- Investors to buy tokens and receive **monthly dividends**.  
- The platform to evolve from a simple DB to a blockchain ecosystem.  

---  

### 📈 3. How It Works?  

#### For Businesses:  
1. **Registration via Tax ID (INN)** → Verification via Checko API.  
2. **Token Issuance** → Define the number of tokens and the revenue share for dividends.  
3. **Profit Data Updates** → Revenue data is submitted to the system.  
4. **Automatic Dividend Distribution** → Dividends are split among token holders.  

#### For Users / Investors:  
1. **Registration/Login** → Email + password.  
2. **Business Selection** → Browse companies and available tokens.  
3. **Token Purchase** → Acquire tokens.  
4. **Monthly Dividends** → Payouts proportional to token holdings.  

---  

### 🧩 4. Project Structure  
Initially, the system is built on a centralized database (`SQLite`) with future scalability:  
- **blockchain/db_manager.py** → Manages companies, tokens, and user balances.  
- **verification/api_client.py** → Verifies company status via Checko API.  
- **utils/logger.py** → Event logging.  
- **main.py** → Entry point, implements core business logic.  
- **blockchain/users.py** → User registration and authentication.  
- **blockchain/records_check.py** → Database content verification.

### 📁 5. Database Tables  

| Table | Description |  
|--------|--------|  
| `businesses` | Stores Tax ID (INN) and company name |  
| `token_issuances` | Number of issued tokens |  
| `users` | Email, name, password |  
| `user_tokens` | User token balances |  
| `dividend_history` | Dividend payout history |  

---  

### 🧠 6. Key Benefits  

| For Businesses | For Investors |  
|-----------|-------------|  
| Alternative to bank loans | Low entry barrier—buy as little as 1 token |  
| Global investor access | Passive income from real revenue |  
| Automatic dividend payouts | Potential token appreciation as the business grows |  
| Transparent financial data | Access to company data via API |  
| Token buyback option | Future secondary market liquidity |  

---  

### 📊 7. Economic Model  

#### Dividend Mechanics:  
Each token grants a share of monthly dividends, calculated as:  

$$
\text{Dividend per Token} = \frac{\text{Business Revenue} \times \text{Profit Share}}{\text{Total Tokens Issued}}
$$

##### Example:  
- Revenue: $10,000  
- Profit Share: 10%  
- Tokens Issued: 10,000  
- Dividend per Token: $0.10  
- Investor with 1,000 tokens earns: $100/month → **10% monthly ROI**  

> 💡 As the business grows, dividends and token value increase.
